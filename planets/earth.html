        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical 
            object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a water
            world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface
            water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global 
            ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's surface. The remaining 29.2% of 
            Earth's surface is land, most of which is located in the form of 
            continental landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land 
            hemisphere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by 
            vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts 
            retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and
            atmospheric water combined. Earth's land is part of Earth's
            crust, consisting of several slowly moving tectonic plates,
            which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and
            earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates 
            a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive 
            solar winds and cosmic radiation.
