        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. 
            It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth. It has 
            only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, 
            an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. 
            Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within 
            the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than 
            Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic 
            field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.
