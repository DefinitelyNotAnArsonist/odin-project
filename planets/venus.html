        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with the densest
            atmosphere of all the rocky bodies in the Solar System, and the only one with a 
            mass and size that is close to that of its orbital neighbour Earth. Orbiting 
            inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it appears in Earth's sky always close to
             the Sun, as either a "morning star" or an "evening star"
        </p>
        <p>
            While this is also true for Mercury, Venus appears much more prominently, 
            since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Moon and the Sun,
             appearing brighter than any other star-like classical planet or any fixed star. With such 
             prominence in Earth's sky, Venus has historically been a common and important object 
             for humans, in both their cultures and astronomy.
